# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview

The AirBnB Clone project is a comprehensive backend application designed to replicate the core functionalities of Airbnb. This project focuses on building a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payment processing.

## Project Goals

The main objectives of this project include:

1. **User Management**: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management
2. **Property Management**: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval
3. **Booking System**: Create a comprehensive booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details
4. **Payment Processing**: Integrate a secure payment system to handle transactions and record payment details
5. **Review System**: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties they have booked
6. **Data Optimization**: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations and caching strategies

## Technology Stack

This project leverages modern technologies to ensure scalability, performance, and maintainability. Here's a detailed breakdown of our tech stack:

### üêç Backend Framework
**Django & Django REST Framework**
- **Purpose**: Primary web framework for building robust RESTful APIs and handling backend logic
- **Why Django**: Provides built-in ORM, admin interface, security features, and rapid development capabilities
- **Why DRF**: Offers powerful tools for API development including serialization, authentication, and browsable API interface

### üóÉÔ∏è Database
**PostgreSQL**
- **Purpose**: Primary relational database for storing all application data including users, properties, bookings, and transactions
- **Why PostgreSQL**: Offers advanced features like JSON support, full-text search, robust ACID compliance, and excellent performance for complex queries

### üîç API Technologies
**GraphQL**
- **Purpose**: Provides a flexible query language allowing clients to request exactly the data they need
- **Why GraphQL**: Reduces over-fetching, enables efficient data loading, and provides a single endpoint for all data operations

**OpenAPI (Swagger)**
- **Purpose**: API documentation standard for clear, interactive documentation of REST endpoints
- **Why OpenAPI**: Ensures consistent API documentation, enables automatic client code generation, and improves developer experience

### ‚ö° Task Queue & Caching
**Celery**
- **Purpose**: Handles asynchronous tasks such as sending email notifications, processing payments, and generating reports
- **Why Celery**: Provides reliable task scheduling, retry mechanisms, and scalable background job processing

**Redis**
- **Purpose**: In-memory data store used for caching, session management, and as a message broker for Celery
- **Why Redis**: Offers high-performance caching, supports various data structures, and provides pub/sub messaging

### üê≥ Containerization & Deployment
**Docker**
- **Purpose**: Containerizes the application for consistent development, testing, and production environments
- **Why Docker**: Ensures environment consistency, simplifies deployment, and enables easy scaling

### üîß Development Tools
**GitHub Actions (CI/CD)**
- **Purpose**: Automates testing, building, and deployment processes
- **Why GitHub Actions**: Integrates seamlessly with GitHub, provides flexible workflow configuration, and supports continuous integration/deployment

### üîê Security & Authentication
**JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
- **Purpose**: Stateless authentication mechanism for secure API access
- **Why JWT**: Provides secure, scalable authentication without server-side session storage
